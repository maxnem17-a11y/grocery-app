# Larder — Project Context for Claude Code

Household grocery intelligence dashboard. Currently mid-migration from a single-file React HTML prototype to a modular Vite project. **The old HTML file is still the source of truth until the new entry point is viable** — we extract from it incrementally.

---

## Stack

- **Build:** Vite (no Tailwind compiler — base utility classes only, see "Constraints" below)
- **UI:** React 18, no router yet
- **Data:** Supabase (PostgREST) — credentials in `CREDENTIALS.md` (gitignored)
- **Deploy:** Static PWA — `index.html` at the git root (parent of this directory) is the live single-file build until the Vite migration is shipped

## Migration principles

1. **Incremental extraction, not parallel build.** Pull symbols out of the canonical `index.html` (at the git root) one at a time into `src/`. Old file stays the canonical truth.
2. **`npm run build` must stay green after every step.**
3. **Smoke-test at `localhost:5173`** against live Supabase before committing.
4. **No behaviour change without explicit scope.** A pure file-move shouldn't alter rendered output.
5. **Don't pre-extract.** Wait until a symbol is consumed by the Vite scaffold before moving it. Avoid orphan files.

---

## Constraints

- **No Tailwind compiler in the Vite scaffold.** Classes are pre-defined base utilities only. Match the patterns already in `App.jsx` / `primitives.jsx`.
- **`sbWrite` helper pattern** (see `src/lib/supabase.js`) for all mutations. Don't write raw fetch calls.
- **PostgREST embed shape** (`?select=*,joined:other_table(*)`) preferred over multiple round-trips.
- **Receipts ordered `delivery_date.asc`** — downstream code expects oldest-first.
- **Audience tagging** for any meal/recipe surface: `whole-household` | `adults-only` | `check`. See household rules below.

---

## Household allergen rules (Khalil-strict)

Khalil (age 2) cannot eat:
- Eggs, all dairy, wheat, lentils, peas, chickpeas, avocado, beef
- All beans, all tree nuts
- **Peanuts are safe.**

Soy sauce = wheat-containing → flag as `check`. Tamari = safe.
Oat milk = possible gluten → flag as `uncertain`.
No one drinks dairy milk — oat/soya are household defaults.

Canonical allergen config: `household_allergens` table in Supabase, surfaced through `AllergensContext` in the live HTML. `src/lib/allergens.js` mirrors the resolution logic.

---

## Known issues (don't "fix" by accident)

See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. The almond-milk → tree-nut classification gap is intentional / documented, not a regression.

## Current state

**Last verified:** 2026-05-16
**Last commit:** `HEAD` — Extract ReceiptsContext + mapReceiptRow (step 7c). See `git show HEAD` for the actual hash; next session should bump this line to that hash per the update protocol.
**Smoke test:** ✅ localhost:5173 boots against live Supabase, all green ticks

### Completed
- Vite scaffold (package.json, vite.config.js, index.html, main.jsx, App.jsx)
- RAW JSON blob pruned in canonical `index.html` (646KB → 414KB)
- `src/lib/supabase.js` (~262 lines, sbWrite helper + mapReceiptRow)
- `src/lib/text.js` (~70 lines)
- `src/lib/allergens.js` (~165 lines)
- `src/lib/pantry-math.js` (~135 lines)
- `src/lib/household-rules.js` (34 lines, never_restock patterns from RAW blob — step 7b)
- `src/contexts/ReceiptsContext.jsx` (~57 lines, ReceiptsProvider + useReceipts hook — step 7c)
- Smoke import of `ReceiptsContext` in `App.jsx` (TODO: remove on first real consumer)
- `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
- `npm run build` green (35 modules)

### Next: Step 7d — TBD

Most likely candidate: port `OrdersView` (the smallest `ReceiptsContext` consumer in the canonical `index.html` — see ~L1850). That would wire `ReceiptsProvider` into the live Vite app for the first time, let us delete the `App.jsx` smoke import, and prove the context end-to-end against real receipts. Confirm scope before starting.

### Deferred

**Step 7a — wire up `primitives.jsx`** (deferred indefinitely)
The file was listed as authored in a prior session but does not exist in this repo (never committed, not on disk; likely lived only in a prior sandbox environment — see the `/home/claude/larder/` path comment in `App.jsx:146` for evidence). Per migration principle #5 ("Don't pre-extract"), defer until a view that actually consumes primitives is being ported. At that point we'll re-author `src/components/primitives.jsx` from the canonical `index.html` alongside the view extraction.

**ReceiptsRefreshContext** — sister context exposing `refresh()` and `localAppend()` for the ReceiptParser save flow. Lives at canonical `index.html` L5364–L5385, wraps the app at L6005. Add when ReceiptParser itself is being ported.

**SKU index** (`buildSkuIndex` / `lookupSku` / `TescoSkusContext`) — tightly coupled with views. Extract alongside the first view that consumes them.

### Update protocol
At the end of each session, update the "Current state" section above:
- Bump "Last verified" date and "Last commit" hash.
- Move completed work from "Next" to "Completed".
- Restate the next planned step(s).
Commit `CLAUDE.md` changes alongside the code changes from that session.

## Tool usage notes

- **Supabase MCP** is available — use it autonomously for reads, ask before destructive writes (DELETE, schema changes).
- **Build feedback loop:** `npm run build` after any extraction, `npm run dev` for live smoke-test.
- **No need to rebuild `node_modules`** — already installed.
